Description
Tired of sifting through the hundreds of posts in your university's roommate finder group and STILL ending up with an incompatible roommate? Introducing Roomie! Roomie allows you to create a profile and input basic information such as Name, Major, Fun Fact, Noise Tolerance, Cleanliness, Sleep Habits, and Wake Time. On the Discover page, users will see all of the other students looking for roommates and can tap on their profiles for more information. Users can also search for a specific person or filter through requirements in order to find a roommate with compatible living habits. The app makes finding the perfect roommate easier and would allow users to make friends with other students as well!

Future features of the would app include:
  * A profile picture
  * Linking to Spotify and displaying top artists
  * Linking to Facebook and displaying mutual friends
  * Adding social media handles and a contact button
  * Actual implementation of user accounts
  * Sorting discover results based on highest similarity

Requirements

iOS
  * Autolayout was used to create this app
  * TableView was used to display the profiles on the Discover page
  * Navigation to the survey and filter
  * API is not integrated, see comments at the end

Backend

Anything else you want your grader to know

The backend team had some difficulty and didn't send me the API soon enough, so I was unable to include the Network. I wrote the code for it but couldn't use the search/filter functions and couldn't send the user survey to database. I've hardcoded some data in the ViewController. Also my laptop broke last week :( It's quite difficult and inconvenient to code in XCode without a laptop, specifically a Mac on this campus. -Vivian, iOS
